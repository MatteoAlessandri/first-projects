          </div>
          <li><span style="font-weight:bold">AFFILIATION:</span> RCM (Lieutenant Double-Yefreitor)</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight:bold">ALIGNMENT:</span> ???</li>
          <p>Harrier Du Bois was born in ‘07, the last year of the Commune of Revachol, before the Coalition's attack, at a time when the Antecentennial Revolution was still going strong. He was born on the ground floor of Revachol's Old Military Hospital in The Pox during a snowstorm. As a child, he suffered a bout of partial infantile paralysis caused by polio, and though he would for the most part physically recover from this condition, it gave him a permanent twinge in his jaw that affects pronunciation of certain words.</p>

<p>In his adolescence, Harry was a member of a street-gang comprised of eight delinquents from Faubourg and North Jamrock calling themselves The Fifteenth Indotribe. Of all the former members, Harry is the only one who still lives.</p>

<p>Harry's twenties coincided with "the New", a time of excess and opulence trigged by an economic upswing in both the Coalition of Nations and Revachol, and leading to the birth of a new music genre, disco, of which Harry himself became a fan. He became especially fond of the Revacholian Disco superstar Guillaume Le Million, whose stage persona and mannerisms he would try to emulate, leading to him adopting The Expression.</p>

<p>Prior to joining the RCM Harry was a high school gym teacher in Grand Couron. He met Dora Ingerlund, his future fiancée, while the two waited at a bus stop. She inspired him to join the Revachol Citizens Militia at the age of 26. Over his 18 total years of service Harry solved 216 cases with a total of 3 confirmed kills, an extremely low number for a member of Precinct 41. His impressive ratio of solved cases placed him above 90 percent of officers in the entire RCM, and earned him two promotions, which he declined, instead being granted the title of lieutenant double-yefreitor and retaining his position as head of the Major Crimes Unit in Precinct 41's C-Wing. Despite his statistics, Harry's intense caseload is implied to have only been made possible through the liberal use of stimulants and other drugs, namely alcohol, which led to instability and unpredictable behaviour while on the job. During a recent case, titled "THE UNSOLVABLE CASE", Harry had a drunken outburst where he rendered a man unable to walk after beating him with his ledger, and some time prior to this he both missed a shot aimed at a fleeing suspect, who he hit in the pelvis, and kidnapped a woman, who he physically held in his apartment against her will. He is also generally known, feared and even suspected to be one of La Puta Madre's peones by the public. Harry's erratic behaviour drove off many former members of Precinct 41, including Guillaume Bevy, but he was not disciplined due to his otherwise exceptional work, and was even offered a promotion (which he declined) during this period.</p>

<p>Approximately six years before the events of Disco Elysium, Dora left Harry and moved to Mirova.</p>

<p>Some time in the past, Harry purchased the horrific necktie, which he gradually started to project a hyperactive and self-destructive personality onto, compelling him to dress in increasingly "disco" clothes, and forget his problems through drinking and substance abuse. Jean confirms that Harry has hallucinated his tie talking to him prior to his amnesia.</p>

<p>Directly preceding the in-game events, Harry and the Major Crimes Unit were called to Martinaise to investigate a report of a hanging. When they arrived, Harry drove off the rest of the unit, screaming at them to "fuck off" because they were "cramping his style. He was the "Detective God." The rest of his tirade were variations on "Fuck everything. All will burn. Detect or die!". He then went on a several-day suicidal bender across the district. He harassed the patrons at the Whirling-in-Rags, waving his gun in their faces and making graphic suicide jokes. He trashed his room and broke the Whirling's taxidermy skua, finally driving the waitress Sylvie Malaìika to resign on the spot just to escape him. He sold his gun to Bird's Nest Roy, wrecked his Coupris 40, and on the final night before he lost his memory, he could be heard in his room at the Whirling screaming "I DON'T WANT TO BE THIS KIND OF ANIMAL ANYMORE" while listening to The Smallest Church in Saint-Saens on loop.</p>

<p>The definite cause of Harry's amnesia is unknown, though he theorizes that it may be a side effect of pale exposure stemming from the two-millimeter hole in the church. Joyce Messier believes that Harry must have been affected with a severe case of encephalopathy caused by his binge-drinking, and Jean believes it's all an act, however, Kim and Trant Heidelstam do not believe this to be the case, and Judit Minot confirms that Harry has had previous amnesiac blackouts in the past. Upon failing a red Shivers skill check in the church, Harry appears to suffer a seizure, during which he experiences deja vu, and then blacks out for thirty minutes. After waking up, Harry tells Kim that he believes it may be related to his memory loss, and Kim agrees that it seems likely.</p>

I am under no illusion that my role isn't a minor one, in the scheme of things... but I embrace it *because* it's my role, and it's yours too, detective, whether you accept it or not!</code>

          <li><span style="font-weight:bold">AFFILIATION:</span> RCM (Lieutenant)</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight:bold">ALIGNMENT:</span> Moralist</li>
          <p>Kim Kitsuragi was born in Revachol around '08 to half-Seolite parents; his grandfather and grandmother on opposite parental sides were from Seol. He's never met his grandparents, and cannot speak Seolite.</p>
          <p>His Seolite ancestry caused others to treat him poorly, calling him racial slurs and causing Kim to struggle with not being considered Revacholian, despite being born and raised in Revachol. He prefers not to associate himself with Seol, instead calling himself a "regular, garden variety Revacholiere."</p>
          <p>When he was 2 years old, his parents were killed during the end of the Antecentennial Revolution. He was spared due to his young age.</p>
          <p>As a child, he dreamed of becoming an aerostatic pilot, and was particularly interested in the revolutionary air brigades. He also had an affinity for the Franconigerian knights. It is heavily implied that he was bullied in high-school for wearing glasses, and is strongly against any unnecessary displays of force against those who are "weaker" because of this.</p>
          <p>At one point, Kim had a complicated relationship with his given name, but decided not to change it.</p>
          <p>Kim has two decades of RCM service under his belt and is assigned to Precinct 57, he has solved a total of 102 cases (officially 104). Although he claims that he is neither the finest, nor the strongest officer at the Precinct, he is notorious enough for Trant Heidelstam to recognize him, and Harry to know his name and statistics offhand. Jean Vicquemare also thinks highly of him, and says Precinct 41 would be flattered if he were to consider transferring. Despite wearing glasses, he passes shooting courses 7 out of 10. This is likely because he is farsighted.</p>
          <p>Kim joined the RCM in '31, at the age of 23, and worked as a juvenile police officer for the next 15 years. He tries to avoid teenagers to prevent setting off the Trauma-and-Stressor Disorder he developed during that time. He was finally reassigned to homicide in '46, at 38. After 9 months of training to infiltrate a pinball ring, he became the pinball champion, and the nicknames "Kim 'Pinball' Kitsuragi" and "The Kimball" stuck. He detests them both.</p>
          <p>He initially worked a year in Processing, handling bodies and evidence. He dislikes the whole department, considering them "butchers and clowns", who are a "wrecking crew" routinely mishandling bodies and evidence. Kim eventually earned his lieutenancy as a member of Criminal Investigation and has since been decorated four times. The last time he had killed anyone was in '47, four years prior to the case, and just a year after his reassignment. His confirmed kill count is 6, which may potentially be elevated to 8 after the Mercenary Tribunal, depending on the outcome.</p>
          <p>Some time before his partnership with Harrier Du Bois, Kim had a partner who earned the nickname "Eyes" from having to show Kim things he was unable to see due to his farsightedness. Their partnership ended poorly, and just saying his name aloud saddens Kim. After the Mercenary Tribunal, an Empathy passive check reveals that Glen was not the first person to die in Kim's place, potentially hinting at a tragic end for Eyes.</p>

          <li><span style="font-weight:bold">AFFILIATION:</span> The Wild Pines Group</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight:bold">ALIGNMENT:</span> Ultraliberal</li>
          <p>Wild Pines representative Joyce Leyton-Messier is an older woman with an English accent, with a Vespertine passport. Appearances can be deceiving, however, as Joyce is not Vespertine, but Revacholian, born in year 3 in the Commune of Revachol. However, rather than a communard, she became the most horrifying of abominations - an ultraliberal - and eventually betrayed the Revolution when the Coalition came knocking. She gained dual citizenship after marrying one Mr Messier, a Vespertine citizen. She finds this handy during travels, and as a Wild Pines representative, she does quite a lot of it.</p>
          <p>Serving as Wild Pine's ambassador to the Union, she has an affinity for sailing. She sails a Cor-de-Leite '19, manufactured in Revachol East, 19 paces long and rated for Category 1 racing, worth more than most RCM members will earn in their entire lives - and decidedly unromantic about it. She still loves participating in regattas, and has taken her boat for a spin in two Insulindic regattas.</p>
          <p>Despite being the Senior Labour Negotiator for the Wild Pines Group, has a very big problem: no one wants to negotiate with her. She came to Martinaise to replace Mr Gaumont, the previous negotiator, hoping to work out a compromise with the Dockworkers’ Union and end to the strike that has been going on for months, resulting in major losses for the Wild Pines. But Evrart Claire, foreman of the Dockworkers’ Union, has been unwilling to make any concessions, and, having kicked out the previous negotiator, isn’t even letting Joyce into the harbour.</p>
          <p>Worse yet, the Union stopped all communication with her following the murder you’re investigating. And so you find Joyce docked by the pier in her sloop, sipping tea, exasperated by the entire situation and three weeks of inactivity.</p>
          <p>This must be something of a new experience for her. Not only is she a professional negotiator, she represents a major logistics conglomerate with a 250-year history — The Wild Pines Group owns the harbour! What’s more: it was the Wild Pines Group that built the district of Martinaise, or at least invested the money for it to be built. Trouble is, Evrart Claire and his twin brother Edgar now unofficially run Martinaise. In this standoff between the Wild Pines Group and the Dockworkers’ Union, who will prevail?</p>
          <p>As befits a representative of the Wild Pines, Joyce has the air of very old money — generations upon generations of politesse and finger sandwiches. She will be more than courteous with you and even helpful — if you can successfully negotiate with her. Beyond information that may aid you in your investigation, however, she has something to offer that came down to her with that very old money: a broad education of the sort one doesn’t usually comes across in impoverished Martinaise. Joyce is a treasure trove of knowledge for an amnesiac detective who doesn’t really understand what planet he’s on and how it came to be the way it is. You just might find yourself whiling away some hours with her by the water, listening to the waves lapping against the hull of her sloop, entranced by her erudition and lulling eloquence.</p>

          <p>Born in Martinaise, the twins Evrart and Edgar with Evrart developing Type 2 diabetes as a result of their financial circumstances. He and his brother attended the same school as Easy Leo and were taught History and Human Studies by Gaston Martin. As teens, the twins were rebellious and destructive. Unlike his twin, Evrart has a lazy eye - amblyopia.</p>
          <p>The Claire brothers made their name in the city in the '30s, thanks to Edgar's intervention during the Union's foreman elections. The brothers have remained in control of the Union ever since, circumventing term limits by switching out for each other after every election.</p>
          <p>Although the brothers are said to be corrupt, they are well-liked by their supporters, particularly Union members, and are generally seen as a positive influence on Martinaise, using their influence to prevent organized crime and build up infrastructure in the district while the Coalition government and the RCM has only neglected them. At the same time, the brothers' opponents tend to see them with nothing but contempt, and they have a habit of silencing their critics (particularly Gary, the Cryptofascist). The brothers have also sought to maintain absolute authority over the district, muscling out potential rivals, such as a tourism company that attempted to rejuvenate the area.</p>

          <p>The Insulindian Phasmid is a large cryptid who lurks in the reeds on the sea fortress island. It posesses amazing mimicry-camouflage skills and disguises itself within the plant matter amidst the reeds. The Phasmid seems to posess not only mystical phasmic powers, but even psychic ones.</p>
          <p>The enormous Phasmid is the focal point of interest to the Cryptozoologist Morell, as well as his wife, Lena, who has previously shared first-hand-account sightings of the creature.</p>
          <p>Technically, it is an unknown species of the order Phantasmodea endemic to the Insulindian isola. For the last three hundred and fifty years is has hidden in plain sight, masquerading as the reeds. Moulding, cloning itself, unfolding at night to play with trash bins and buoys.</p>
          <p>It went unnoticed by the first settlers and the land surveyors of the suzerain. Also by the soldiers of the Revolution and the officials of the occupation. Even the Semenese islanders who came here first, but did not stay, have not seen it.</p>
          <p>Even the 4,000-year-old Seraseolitic civilization buried deep in the sediment did not. They had stone tools and silk, but the same brains, yet they missed it. Notably, the phasmid was still young then, as it had not developed the mutation needed for parthenogenesis yet, and scoured the neolithic hinterland as distinct individuals, not clones.</p>
          <p>The phasmid has stayed hidden through four forms of government and two scientific revolutions. Until it was accidentally discovered by a detective of the Citizens Militia in Revachol, district of Martinaise, March '51.</p>
