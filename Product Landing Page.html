        <h1>PLAY AS A DETECTIVE</h1>
        <p>You’re a detective with a unique skill system at your disposal and a whole city block to carve your path across. Interrogate unforgettable characters, crack murders, or take bribes. Become a hero or an absolute disaster of a human being.</p>
        <h1>FEATURES</h1>
        <ul>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Full voice acting.</span> All of the city's beautiful people are brought to life with full English voiceover. Play characters against each other, try to help them, or fall hopelessly in love as each word is spoken to you with the appropriate accent and emotion.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold">New political vision quests.</span> Face the reality of your worldview as your political compass leads you down new paths. Discover more citizens, a whole extra area, and monumental sights as you leave an even bigger mark on the world by chasing your dreams.
</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Unprecedented freedom of choice​.</span> Intimidate, sweet-talk, resort to violence, write poetry, sing karaoke, dance like a beast, or solve the meaning of life. Disco Elysium - The Final Cut is the most faithful representation of desktop role playing ever attempted in video games.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Countless tools for role playing.​</span> Mix and match from 24 wildly different skills. Develop a personal style with over 80 clothing items. Wield 14 tools from guns to flashlights to a boombox, or pour yourself a cocktail of 6 different psychoactive substances. Develop your character even further with 60 wild ​thoughts ​to think – with the detective's Thought Cabinet.
</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold">A revolutionary dialogue system with unforgettable characters.</span> ​The world is alive with real people, not extras. Ask probing questions, make insightful observations, or express your wildest desires as you play cop or something completely different. Disco Elysium's revolutionary dialogue system lets you do almost anything.
</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Carve your unique path across the city​.</span> Explore, manipulate, collect tare, or become a millionaire in an open world unlike anything you've seen before. The city of Revachol is yours for the taking, one small piece at a time. From the streets to the beaches – and beyond.
</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Hard boiled, hard core.</span> ​Death, sex, taxes, and disco – nothing is off the table. Revachol is a real place with real challenges. Solve a massive murder investigation, or relax and kick back with sprawling side-cases. The detective decides, the citizens abide.</li>
